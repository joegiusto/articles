## Articles React App (src)

The code base for the Articles [website](https://articles.media). We use a MERN Stack which consist of React for our frontend then MongoDB, Express and Node.js for our backend.

## Articles Server (iso-server)

Even though we want Articles to be as transparent as possible the code for the server might come down soon as we see it being nothing but a security risk. This site will be getting attacked and by exposing this code we are just putting a target on our backs but at the same time maybe others might catch something we don't. Only time will tell. Some considerations for the future would be getting our site working on the [Next.js Framework](https://nextjs.org/) as well as a single package.json for all of our dependencies. Right now our site is a SPA which is definitely hurting load times and SEO performance, making the switch to server-side-rendering/isomorphic is needed as soon as possible so anyone with experience in this and is interested in helping please reach out.

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to live up to Articles transparency is key philosophy, and let our supporters see behind the scene workings. If you want to help us out then we would be grateful for any bugfixes and improvements. Please keep any Pull Request limited to a single feature/route, if you jump around all over the place with a request it will possibly not be accepted or take a while to test.
